# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of famous machine learning algorithms built from scratch using only the `numpy` and `math` modules. The goal of this repository is to help users understand the fundamental principles of machine learning by providing simple, clear implementations of commonly used algorithms without relying on external libraries like `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow`.

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific algorithm and contains the necessary code and explanations to help you understand the inner workings of that algorithm.

## Algorithms Included

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

## Why This Repo?

- **Learning by Doing**: By implementing algorithms from scratch, you get a deeper understanding of the concepts that power machine learning.
- **Simplicity**: The implementations use only `numpy` and `math`, so you can focus on the core logic without any external dependencies.
- **Easy to Follow**: Each algorithm is placed in its own folder with code and explanations to make it easy to follow.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
